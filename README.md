The "final_code.ino" is the most important file in this project where you find all answers for tasks asked in the specifications, as for line follower code you find the basic skeleton for this project (just a line follower program without solving any map's tasks) .
PS: you need an arduino IDE and a solidworks software to see what this files contain.
